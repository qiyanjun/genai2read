#### Low-Rank Adaptation for Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Review

+ The rapid advancement of foundation modelslarge-scale neural networks trained on diverse, extensive datasetshas revolutionized artificial intelligence, enabling unprecedented advancements across domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and scientific discovery. However, the substantial parameter count of these models, often reaching billions or trillions, poses significant challenges in adapting them to specific downstream tasks. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly promising approach for mitigating these challenges, offering a parameter-efficient mechanism to fine-tune foundation models with minimal computational overhead. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of LoRA techniques beyond large Language Models to general foundation models, including recent techniques foundations, emerging frontiers and applications of low-rank adaptation across multiple domains. Finally, this survey discusses key challenges and future research directions in theoretical understanding, scalability, and robustness. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working with efficient foundation model adaptation.

+ Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.

#### DoRA: Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation
+ [Submitted on 14 Feb 2024 (v1), last revised 9 Jul 2024 (this version, v6)]
+ Shih-Yang Liu, Chien-Yi Wang, Hongxu Yin, Pavlo Molchanov, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Kwang-Ting Cheng, Min-Hung Chen
+ Among the widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, LoRA and its variants have gained considerable popularity because of avoiding additional inference costs. However, there still often exists an accuracy gap between these methods and full fine-tuning (FT). In this work, we first introduce a novel weight decomposition analysis to investigate the inherent differences between FT and LoRA. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FT from the findings, we propose Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA). DoRA decomposes the pre-trained weight into two components, magnitude and direction, for fine-tuning, specifically employing LoRA for directional updates to efficiently minimize the number of trainable parameters. By employing \ours, we enhance both the learning capacity and training stability of LoRA while avoiding any additional inference overhead. \ours~consistently outperforms LoRA on fine-tuning LLaMA, LLaVA, and VL-BART on various downstream tasks, such as commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and image/video-text understanding.
