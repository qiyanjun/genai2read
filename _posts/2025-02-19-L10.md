+ AutoGen v0.4

Introduces a cohesive AutoGen ecosystem that includes the framework, developer tools, and applications. The framework’s layered architecture clearly defines each layer’s functionality. It supports both first-party and third-party applications and extensions.
Microsoft Research announces AutoGen v0.4, a major update to their multi-agent AI framework. The new version introduces a complete redesign with an asynchronous, event-driven architecture that improves code quality, robustness, and scalability. Key features include modular components, built-in debugging tools, cross-language support, and enhanced observability through OpenTelemetry integration.

The update brings a new three-layered framework architecture consisting of core building blocks, AgentChat API, and extensions. It also introduces improved developer tools including AutoGen Bench for performance testing, an upgraded AutoGen Studio with real-time agent updates and visual team building, and Magentic-One, a new generalist multi-agent application for handling web and file-based tasks. The release maintains backward compatibility through the AgentChat API, making the migration from v0.2 straightforward while adding new capabilities like streaming messages and improved task progress management.
