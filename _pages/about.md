+ This website aims to educate myself (+my collaborators) to catch up with the fast growing Generative AI literature and their applications.
+ This website includes a (growing) list of materials I read for the above purpose.
+ I hope this website helps people who share similar interests or want to learn similar topics.
+ Please feel free to email me (yanjun.research@gmail.com), if you have  comments, questions or recommendations.
